				<p>I did the funny thing heeheehoohoo</p>
                <p>Linux Mint always has an installation of VirtualBox on it, meaning if I have an ISO file I can boot with whatever operating system I want, and seeing as I have a compact disk for fucking Windows 7, I was able to create a VM file that'll run windows after a couple days. Thing is I know this computer will never be able to run this properly, so I'm attempting to salvage whatever I can from the multitude of PCs I have lying around my house.<br><br>
                The main idea at this point is that I can get a PC case going with a bunch of much-needed components and then hook it up to the raspberry pi as a sort of motherboard in order to get some more computing power, but I'm dumb as fuck, so I'm gonna have to do a lot of googling for this.</p>

				<p>But yeah. It'll be a while before I'm back up and running fully.<br><br>
				That'll be all for now. Have a good one, and remember, god wakes up at 5AM.</p>
				<p>Oh, and I graduated today. That was it's own little thing.</p>
