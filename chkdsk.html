				<p>Hey guys.</p>
				<p>So I've looked into using the computers at my local library before but they have a bunch of firewalling B.S. on the web browsers there so I can't do anything fun.</p>
				<p style="font-size:28px">Buuuuut...</p>
				<p>I believe it's <i>only</i> on the modified version of internet explorer they have, so I could probably get my flash drive of all the windows programs I want that need internet (steam, openTTD, etc.) and just opening them up from there. If I'm right then the programs themselves won't be blocked, just the web traffic coming from the traffic from the browser. So here's to hoping.<br><br>
				In other shit, I've been attempting to fix my old PC, the sorta custom one. The problem with it mainly is it just shutting off at random about 5 minutes after being turned on without warning. It feels like a hardware problem, most likely with the motherboard or something. Dunno much about it, but I've just been running a bunch of diagnostics using the BIOS and CHKDSK.<br><br>
				Anyways, that's the main highlights of what I've been doing here. Have a good one, and remember, it's not credit card fraud, it's a large-scale investment in negative credit.</p>
