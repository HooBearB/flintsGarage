				<p>Morning y'all.</p>
				<p>This morning I rediscovered the fact that I had the foresight to mount this website as a remote in my visual studio workspace file. It's only been 6 days since that. I think I'll be using this as some sort of journal. The only computer I have at the moment is a raspberry pi 4 that I booted with Mint Linux, which I believe makes it a computer. But this means that the only things I can do now is code and browse the internet through Lynx, that one browser that runs in the fucking command line. I love it.<br><br>
				Unfortunately, this means I can't send any data through Lynx, not that I would feasibly be able to do so anyway. The external network card I have to use since I configured my router to use OpenWRT has fuck all in terms of bandwidth. Meaning loading anything above 50kb will be a fucking nightmare. And according to wikipedia, anything worthwhile will be at least 12mb. That shit would take hours.<br><br>
				But I can still code and publish this website thankfully. It might take hours to push this update, due to things like my card using sequential connection instead of parallel, but thankfully it won't shit the bed and refuse to publish anything to Neocities. Plus I pulled a shitton of games (~64 GB) off of itch.io and I'll be running em through Wine. Might make a video review out of that later.<br><br>
				But hey, graduation is in 4 days. Hooray for that shit.</p>
